- User added comma could interfere with split

After testing the below doesn't work...
- User can inject code because of use of innerHTML

Include selects when changing button background colors

If the website can be restored with crtl+t the next day, would the website have the same date and data? (not be reloaded)

Would that mean that in addStreak() the streak should be checked again?

Consider making better animations. lol

When too much text is in pane, add a width and background color to pane that mimics the pane and change it depending on scrollHeight

A note:

There also has to be a localstorage/cookie to check if streak was added to because then they can add as much times in one day

When allItems is saved to localStorage, replace ',' with another letter and when it's loaded, split by that letter
This lets users add commas in their panes

Tested next month, doesn't work need to change system

Add popup for Firefox users to disable protection settings for the streak

When newItem is added, buttons aren't rounded

Automatically extend when scrollHeight exceeds 300

Widgets:

Calender

Reminder

Time

Add pane in specific positions

Sometimes cookie expiration date is set two days after

Extra text is made into divs and disapear because first time they are SAVED as divs second time they are ADDED as divs and third they are not added because they are seperate to p as div

Add labels for importance/colors
*/
/*
// Temporary way of asking user

var check = prompt('Answer with y/n: Do you allow cookies and localstorage? (To save your streak and all the customizations)');

if (check != 'y') {
  close(window)
}

if (check == '' || check == null)  {
  close(window)
}

When blue button is pressed twice, make size of pane back to original

New way to store 'Unnamed pane|Description|labels: important*due|||'

The ||| is just empty configs so when you refer to a config you can just use a specific index

Reward system:

Streak of 50 - Yay (button)

When yay pressed give confetti and popup with a reward if the user adds rewards for example breaks

Popup to show due today

Filter panes

On topbar have button that shows all your due stuff

Sections

Have different sections either it goes like this:

Game devlog

Pane Pane2

Section2

Pane AnotherPane

Or at the topbar there is a bunch of buttons that contain the sections

Floating title and description (seperate)
